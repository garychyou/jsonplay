Performance:
1. to handle very large input files
  JSONParser load everything into memory.  this is not scalable.  
  The right way is to use a stream parser, like the SAX parser for xml file.
  
 
2. to handle large change file.  when streaming in the file line bye line, don't collect into a list.
   Instead, as soon as one line is processed, kick out the operation.

   parallel streams are even better.   


3. Known issue,
There are should be validation of the input changes.
For example, adding a non-exist user_id, or a non-exist song_id, should not rejected. 
In the Jason file, there are users data and songs data. These data can be used to do the validation.

Another example,
if a user or a song is deleted, it should cascade to the playlist.  


4. How to run it.
 1) if you have Eclipse 
   You load this mvn project and run it in Eclipse.
   You need set one argument: baseDir
 2).  create a java command line 
 3).  use some installer  


5. Misc.
To read a json file:
 on linux: jq . output.json
